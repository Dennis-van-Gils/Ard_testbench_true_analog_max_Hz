# Arduino (Atmel SAMD) testbench for true analog-out signal generation using an interrupt timer and direct port access.
Maximum achieved stable DAC output frequency is 20 kHz, tested on an Arduino M0 Pro with an oscilloscope. That means that acceptable sine waves with frequencies of up to ~500 Hz are feasible, albeit with some stepping occuring at these high frequencies. Sine waves <= 100 Hz are smooth.
